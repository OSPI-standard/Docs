Once the recording is complete, by default, Ospi uploads all recordings to Ospi's AWS S3 bucket. Additionally, a presigned URL is generated with a 7-day expiry. The recording can be accessed using the [`downloadUrl`](/api/?v=v2#/operations/start_recording) associated with each recording.

However, Ospi provides users with the flexibility to choose whether or not to upload their recordings to Ospi's S3 bucket. If you wish to disable uploads to Ospi's bucket, you can set the `dyte_bucket_config` parameter to false in the [Start Recording endpoint](/api/?v=v2#/operations/start_recording).

For example:

```json
{
  "dyte_bucket_config": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

:::info note

If you haven't specified an external storage configuration and also disabled uploads to Ospi's bucket, then the recording will not be uploaded to any location. It is considered as an invalid recording.

For more information on how to set your extrenal storage configuration, see [Publish Recorded File to Your Cloud Provider](/guides/capabilities/recording/custom-cloud-storage).
